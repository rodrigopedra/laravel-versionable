# Versionable
## Easy to use Model versioning for Laravel 5.6

> Fork of https://github.com/mpociot/versionable

Keep track of all your model changes and revert to previous versions of it.


```php
// Restore to the previous change
$content->previousVersion()->revert();

// Get model from a version
$oldModel = Version::find(100)->getModel();
```

## Installation

In order to add Versionable to your project, just add 

    "mpociot/versionable": "~2.0"

to your composer.json. Then run `composer install` or `composer update`.

Or run `composer require mpociot/versionable ` if you prefere that.

Run the migrations to create the "versions" table that will hold all version information.

```bash
php artisan migrate --path=vendor/mpociot/versionable/src/migrations
```

<a name="usage" />

## Usage

Let the Models you want to set under version control use the `VersionableTrait`.

```php
class Content extends Model {
	
	use Mpociot\Versionable\VersionableTrait;
	
}
```
That's it!

Every time you update your model, a new version containing the previous attributes will be stored in your database. 

All timestamps and the optional soft-delete timestamp will be ignored.

### Exclude attributes from versioning

Sometimes you don't want to create a version *every* time an attribute on your model changes. For example your User model might have a `last_login_at` attribute. 
I'm pretty sure you don't want to create a new version of your User model every time that user logs in.

To exclude specific attributes from versioning, add a new array property to your model named `dontVersionFields`.

```php
class User extends Model {
	
	use Mpociot\Versionable\VersionableTrait;
	
	/**
	 * @var array
	 */
	protected $dontVersionFields = [ 'last_login_at' ];

}
```

<a name="retrieve" />

### Retrieving all versions associated to a model

To retrieve all stored versions use the `versions` attribute on your model.

This attribute can also be accessed like any other Laravel relation, since it is a `MorphMany` relation.

```php
$model->versions;
```

<a name="diff" />

### Getting a diff of two versions

If you want to know, what exactly has changed between two versions, use the version model's `diff` method.

The diff method takes a version model as an argument. This defines the version to diff against. If no version is provided, it will use the current version.

```php
/**
 * Create a diff against the current version
 */
$diff = $page->previousVersion()->diff();


/**
 * Create a diff against a specific version
 */
$diff = $page->currentVersion()->diff( $version );
```

The result will be an associative array containing the attribute name as the key, and the different attribute value.

### Revert to a previous version

Saving versions is pretty cool, but the real benefit will be the ability to revert to a specific version.

There are multiple ways to do this.

**Revert to the previous version**

You can easily revert to the version prior to the currently active version using:

```php
$content->previousVersion()->revert();
```

**Revert to a specific version ID**

You can also revert to a specific version ID of a model using:

```php
$revertedModel = Version::find( $version_id )->revert();
```
